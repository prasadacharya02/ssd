# ENTROPY recovery drill — detect → contain → recover, measured
# benchmark/recovery_drill.py
#
# For each attack scenario (and baseline mode) a full drill of the
# recovery loop on a throwaway victim estate:
#
#   1. Lay the pre-attack estate and remember every byte.
#   2. Startup baseline capture (real BackupManager — what the
#      production pipeline does at monitor start).
#   3. Replay the attack ops through the REAL chain:
#      EntropyAnalyzer -> capture every state -> collect_threat_flags
#      -> make_decision -> execute_response with REAL quarantine and
#      REAL restore (no dry-run — the files are throwaway).
#   4. Byte-for-byte verification of the post-drill estate, and RTO:
#         - RTO in file operations (first / full recovery)
#         - RTO in attacker-clock seconds (the scenario's own timing)
#         - measured wall time of the response work itself
#
# Recovery semantics (honest):
#   - "recovered"  = the victim's pre-attack bytes are back on disk.
#                    For rename attacks the file is renamed back to
#                    its original name (same as production).
#   - "contained"  = the encrypted file was quarantined but no clean
#                    version existed / was found — data is preserved
#                    in quarantine but NOT restored.
#   - attacker-created files (notes, fresh payloads) are reported
#     separately; containing them is success, not a recovery failure.
#
# Run:  python -m benchmark.recovery_drill
