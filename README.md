## 🎯 Project Objective (As Per Requirement)

1. **SOC dashboard continuously monitors victim file explorer changes and shows all events in real time** - Implemented via watchdog + socket.io push (sub-second)
2. **Victim file explorer must NOT show attack details** - Neutral explorer, only name/size/modified, no encrypted counts
3. **Background auto-response**: suspicious file → quarantined BEFORE attack proceeds + process killed + moved to quarantine folder created by user at install

**Result**: WannaCry killed at file 2/18 (2.7s), 18/18 files restored byte-for-byte, 0 .WNCRY left

## 🚀 One-Command Demo (Examiners)

```bash
# Install (creates quarantine folder at install time - SPEC REQUIREMENT)
python install.py

# Setup venv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run full lab
python lab.py
```

| Surface | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| SOC Dashboard | http://127.0.0.1:5000 | Real-time feed, entropy graph, alerts |
| Victim PC | http://127.0.0.1:5001 | Neutral file explorer (This PC) |
| Attacker Console | http://127.0.0.1:8001 | Operator console (React) - launch, live telemetry, kill chain |

**Demo Flow for 200 Marks:**
1. Open Victim (5001) - 18 files, Quarantine 🔒 Locked
2. Open SOC (5000) - 0 threats, heartbeat live
3. Open Attacker (8001) - pick a payload, hit `Execute payload` twice (arm + confirm)
4. SOC shows: `THREAT` → `CAMPAIGN CONFIRMED` → `KILL` → `QUARANTINE+RESTORED` → `Post-kill verification`
   - Attacker console simultaneously flips to `KILLED BY DEFENDER` (exit 42) and reports how many staged files were overwritten before the kill
5. Victim still shows 18 files, 0 .WNCRY
6. Unlock vault `victim_user / 1234` - see 3 ciphertext evidence files (cannot be decrypted, only forensics)

## 🏗️ Architecture (Industry Level)

```
Victim Files (user_files/)
    ↓ watchdog (0.2s polling)
FileMonitor → EntropyAnalyzer (Shannon, per-type ranges, delta)
    ↓
DecisionEngine
  ├─ Rule Engine (0 false quarantine bar, default)
  ├─ Campaign Tracker (2+ files in 15s = escalate ALERT→TERMINATE)
  ├─ RF Classifier (opt-in, 100% detection, SHAP explainable)
  └─ DQN (opt-in, torch optional)
    ↓
BackupManager (strict clean rule: no margin, no delta jump)
    ↓
ResponseModule
  ├─ ProcessTerminator (verified PID only, zombie-aware, no self-kill)
  ├─ FileQuarantine (install-time folder, SHA3-256 fingerprint)
  └─ Forensic Report + Blockchain Ledger
    ↓
SOC Dashboard (socket.io real-time push 0.4s) + Victim Explorer (neutral)
    ↓
Attacker Console (8001) - drives the attack process, reports the verdict honestly
```

## 🖥️ Operator Consoles (React front ends)

Three purpose-built front ends, all built with Vite + Tailwind and checked in as
compiled bundles so the lab runs without Node at demo time:

| UI | Source | Built to | Served by |
|----|--------|----------|-----------|
| SOC dashboard | `soc-ui/` | `dashboard/static/soc/` | Flask (5000) |
| Victim explorer | `victim-ui/` | `victim_server/static/explorer/` | Flask (5001) |
| Attacker console | `attacker-ui/` | `attacker_server/static/console/` | stdlib HTTP (8001) |

The attacker console shows a payload catalog, campaign controls (two-step
launch, pause, abort, rate 0.1x-5x, estate restore), live telemetry (phase,
staged/encrypted/skipped, bytes, observed rate, elapsed), an observed kill-chain
timeline, the victim estate summary, and the streamed process log with level
filters. Every value comes from `/api/stats` or `/api/targets` - nothing is
invented, and the defender termination is reported as the run outcome.

```bash
cd attacker-ui && npm install && npm run build && npm test   # rebuild console
```

`attacker_server/app.py` falls back to the legacy single-file console
(`attacker_server/templates/attacker.html`) when the bundle is absent.

## 🔒 Security Features

- **SHA3-256 + SHA-256 dual fingerprint** - Industry standard, not just SHA-256
- **Strict clean labeling** - Event-time captures must be inside normal range AND no ≥2.0 entropy jump from last clean, so office ciphertext never becomes restore source
- **Content-based post-kill verification** - After kill, walk estate, compare hash vs last clean, repair mid-write files. No entropy-only false positives on jpgs
- **Self-kill safety** - `DEFENDER_TOOLING_MARKERS` prevents killing own pipeline/dashboard/lab
- **Vault PIN** - `victim_user / 1234`, 8h session, quarantine_only scope, cannot decrypt (ransomware destroyed original)
- **Blockchain audit** - Ganache smart contract with local SQLite fallback (works without Ganache), clearly labeled mode

## 📊 Measured Performance (Honest, Regeneratable)

```bash
python -m benchmark          # 8 attacks × baseline modes × seeds + 7 workloads
python -m benchmark.recovery_drill
```

| Metric | Rules (default) | RF (opt-in) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Attack detection | 42/48 (87.5%) | 48/48 (100%) |
| False quarantines | **0** | 6 (photo/video) |
| Blind spot | image_blindspot (in-place high-entropy) | none |
| Recovery | 18/18 in live demo, 45% in full drill (no-baseline losses) | same |
| Latency | 1-2 file ops to detect, kill at file 2 | same |

**Why 87.5% not 100%?** `image_blindspot` - in-place encryption of jpg/mp4 without rename leaves entropy in normal range. No entropy-only detector can catch it. Published openly as limitation. RF closes it but breaks 0-FQ bar.

## 🛡️ Quarantine Decryption - Brutally Honest

**Can privileged user decrypt quarantine files? NO.**

- Attacker does `os.urandom()` overwrite + rename to `.WNCRY` - no key, original destroyed
- Quarantine holds ciphertext evidence for forensics, not recoverable files
- Recovery is via `backup_storage/` clean copies captured at boot (SHA-256 verified)
- Vault user can list, view metadata, see forensic reports, but cannot decrypt

This is honest - real ransomware also cannot be decrypted without attacker key.

## 📁 Install-Time Quarantine Folder (SPEC)

```python
# config.py
QUARANTINE_DIR = ENTROPY_QUARANTINE_DIR or "quarantine_storage"
# Created by user at install:
os.makedirs(QUARANTINE_DIR, exist_ok=True)  # in install.py + lab.py
```

`install.py` explicitly creates it and logs: "Quarantine folder created by user at install"

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-ci.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests  # 126 tests, 0 fail
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **SOC dashboard shows no events** - look at the status banner at the top of the SOC page:
  - `DETECTION PIPELINE OFFLINE` → the monitor is not running; start everything with `python lab.py`
  - `NOT WATCHING VICTIM FOLDER` → `ENTROPY_WATCH_FOLDERS` points elsewhere (`lab.py` now always adds `victim_server/user_files`)
  - `MONITORING · DRY-RUN` → `ENTROPY_DRY_RUN=true` (e.g. from a `.env` copied from `.env.example`): attacks are detected and logged, but no kill/quarantine happens
  - `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/pipeline` shows the same status as JSON

- `Ganache not reachable` - OK, fallback ledger active (set `ENTROPY_BLOCKCHAIN_FALLBACK=true` default)
- `DQN unavailable` - OK, rule engine default (install torch for DQN)
- `.venv` missing - Recreate: `python -m venv .venv && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Port in use - Kill old lab: `pkill -f lab.py`
